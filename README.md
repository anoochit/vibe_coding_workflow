# VIBE Coding Workflow

1.  **Brainstorm:** Generate initial ideas and concepts for the feature or project.
2.  **Define Product Requirements:** Clearly document the specifications, goals, and constraints based on the brainstorming session.
3.  **Task Breakdown:** Convert the defined product requirements into smaller, actionable development tickets or user stories. (Applying a structured thinking model here can be beneficial).
4.  **Pre-coding Research:** Before starting implementation, thoroughly investigate potential approaches, relevant technologies, libraries, and potential challenges associated with each ticket.
5.  **Implementation:** Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code to fulfill the ticket's requirements. (AI coding assistants like Copilot or Claude can optionally be leveraged during this phase).
6.  **Testing:** Rigorously test the implemented code using appropriate methods (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, manual validation) to ensure it functions correctly and meets quality standards.
7.  **Version Control:** Commit the code changes for the completed feature or task to the version control system (e.g., Git) and push them to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub). Strive for atomic commits related to specific features or logical units of work.
