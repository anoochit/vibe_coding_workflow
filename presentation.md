# VIBE Coding Workflow

A structured approach to software development.




---

# 1. Brainstorm

*   Generate initial ideas and concepts for the feature or project.

---

# 2. Define Product Requirements

*   Clearly document the specifications, goals, and constraints based on the brainstorming session.

---

# 3. Task Breakdown

*   Convert the defined product requirements into smaller, actionable development tickets or user stories.
*   (Applying a structured thinking model here can be beneficial).

---

# 4. Pre-coding Research

*   Before starting implementation, thoroughly investigate:
    *   Potential approaches
    *   Relevant technologies & libraries
    *   Potential challenges associated with each ticket.

---

# 5. Implementation

*   Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code to fulfill the ticket's requirements.
*   (AI coding assistants like Copilot or Claude can optionally be leveraged during this phase).

---

# 6. Testing

*   Rigorously test the implemented code using appropriate methods:
    *   Unit tests
    *   Integration tests
    *   Manual validation
*   Ensure it functions correctly and meets quality standards.

---

# 7. Version Control

*   Commit code changes for the completed feature/task to the version control system (e.g., Git).
*   Push changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
*   Strive for atomic commits related to specific features or logical units of work.
